# Reflection

This week assignment we had to build a simple interactive game to engage our visitors. Games such as these are known as an “idling games” or “incremental games”. I found this week's assignment a bit easier than last week's. We worked on more JavaScript throughout the week, so my understanding of it was a bit better. Also, I used similar methods for this assignment to those I used in last week's.

# Requirements

- ✅ 🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
- ✅ 🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
- ✅ 🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
- ✅ 🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
- ✅ 🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second. Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

# Stretch Requirements

- ✅ 🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
- ✅ 🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
- ✅ 🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.

# requirements that I wasn't able to achieve

- ❌ 🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.
- ❌ 🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch.

- This was my original design for my Cookie Clicker game, but as you can tell, the finished product has changed a little
