# Reflection

This week assignment we had to build a simple interactive game to engage our visitors. Games such as these are known as an “idling games” or “incremental games”.

# Requirements

- ✅ 🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
- ✅ 🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
- 🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
- ✅ 🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
- 🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second. Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

# Stretch Requirements

- ✅ 🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
- 🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
- 🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.
- 🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch.
- 🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.
