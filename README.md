# Reflection

For this week's assignment, we had to build a simple interactive game to engage visitors. Games like these are known as idle games or incremental games. I found this assignment a bit easier than last week's, mainly because we focused more on JavaScript throughout the week, which improved my understanding. It also helped that I was able to use some of the same methods from last week's assignment. Additionally, I'm finding it really useful to leave notes in my code, especially in JavaScript, to help me remember the steps and understand what each part does.

# Requirements

- ✅ 🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
- ✅ 🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
- ✅ 🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
- ✅ 🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
- ✅ 🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second. Managing the game state includes saving progress and updating the DOM.

# Stretch Requirements

- ✅ 🏹 Consolidate upgrade management by managing all upgrades in a single function.
- ✅ 🏹 Improve UX with animations, sound effects, or other visual effects.
- ✅ 🏹 Create a menu for users to adjust game options like sound effects or display preferences.
- ✅ 🏹 Fantastic use of README to provide important information such as a description of the project, how to deploy and other app information.

# requirements that I wasn't able to achieve

- ❌ 🏹 Implement error handling using try/catch.

# Errors or Bugs I Encountered

- I keep getting a 404 error code on my console (⬇️Image below⬇️). I've looked into what it is and how to solve it. It's saying I need to create a favicon.ico file with an image and then link it in with my HTML.
- I've figured out what it is and why I'm getting the error. I have now fixed the error, but I'm going to leave this in, as any more info on this would be helpful.

# What went really well and what could have gone better?

- I had hoped I would have had more time to style the game a bit more, but I made sure that everything was working first and all the main goals were met.
- I would have liked to change the names of the upgrades to fit with the theme of my game.

# Wireframe

- This was my original design for my Cookie Clicker game, but as you can tell, the finished product has changed a little. That's mainly due to how I wanted the clickable image to sit with the background so it didn't look out of place.
